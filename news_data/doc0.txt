The egg is 17 centimetres long and 8 centimetres wide.Features of the skeleton suggest it is an oviraptorid – a two-legged dinosaur that had a bird-like head and feathers.The egg appears to be 72 to 66 million years old. It was probably buried rapidly in sand or mud to allow its remarkable preservation, says Ma. “It is very rare to find dinosaur embryos, especially ones that are intact,” she says.The embryos of modern birds also adopt a tucked posture to protect themselves for hatching. This suggests the posture first evolved in dinosaurs, not in modern birds as was previously thought, says Ma. “We’ve never had embryos well-preserved enough to see this before,” she says.A reconstruction of an oviraptorosaur dinosaur embryo that is close to hatchingLida XingA reconstruction of an oviraptorosaur dinosaur embryo that is close to hatchingLida XingLittle is known about the egg’s origins, except that it was found in Shahe Industrial Park in Ganzhou City in southern China and donated to the museum in 2000. “We’re not sure how it was first discovered but we guess it was something related to construction work,” says Ma.Journal reference: iScience, DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103516 Journal reference: iScience, DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103516 More on these topics:
