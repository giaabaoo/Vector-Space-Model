But now thousands of children with autism are making friends and learning social skills by playing a version of online building game Minecraft.Stuart Duncan got the idea through a popular blog he ran about his own experiences with autism as well as bringing up a son with autism. Other parents with autistic children started telling him that their kids were crazy about a game that let them explore a randomly generated wilderness. However, despite loving the game, many of the children were being bullied by other players.So, in 2013, Duncan, a web developer in Timmins, Canada, set up a server to run a version of Minecraft exclusively for children with autism and their families. He thought the invite-only server would attract 10 or 20 people. To his surprise, hundreds requested to join in the first few days.Now, almost three years later, running \u201cAutcraft\u201d is his full-time job. The community boasts nearly 7000 members, along with a team of admins to help manage its many activities. \u201cParents see such a benefit for themselves and their children,\u201d says Duncan.\u201cMinecraft strips away the pressures and distractions of the real world. You can really just be yourself\u201cThe server caught the eye of Kate Ringland at the University of California, Irvine. She has spent 60 hours inside this virtual world, watching how the kids play and chat to one another. Ringland sees Autcraft as not just another online community, but as a tool that helps autistic children practise social skills. She will present her work at the Human Factors in Computing conference in San Jose, California, next month.In Minecraft, you manipulate blocks of materials like wood and stone to build whatever you like \u2013 from painstaking recreations of cities to simple computers. \u201cThis is a great way for them to play a game they love, but also have a social experience,\u201d says Ringland. \u201cIt\u2019s giving an alternative way for these kids to express themselves and communicate without the stresses of the physical life stuff.\u201dEveryday social situations can be challenging for autistic children, who may struggle to pick up on social cues or understand another person\u2019s perspective. Duncan thinks Minecraft strips away the pressures typical of the real world. There is no noisy or unfamiliar environment to distract you, no pressure to track the other person\u2019s facial expressions or worry about eye contact. \u201cWith Minecraft, you can really just be yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe social interactions, the relationships, the communication \u2013 everything just boils down to you and your keyboard.\u201dTo join Autcraft, you must fill out an application. Once approved, you are free to roam the landscape and build your own structures. You can also take part in group games \u2013 like massive battles against \u201cwithers\u201d, a kind of ghostly villain \u2013 or build things as a team. But you have to stick to some rules. Harassing other players or destroying their property can get you banned. A spin-off server for teenagers is slightly more permissive.Ringland observed players on Autcraft and combed through discussions on related online forums. She saw people build friendships and have fun together. She also saw kids expressing their feelings \u2013 joy over a good time in the game, and anxiety or sadness about problems in the real world. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reflection going on,\u201d she says. \u201cMinecraft is supporting a lot of these social behaviours.\u201dJoining a community like Autcraft could be a good first step to feeling less socially anxious and more engaged, says Elizabeth Laugeson, director of the PEERS Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles, which teaches young adults with autism how to build relationships. But it shouldn\u2019t be the only outlet for learning these skills, she says. \u201cMinecraft is not necessarily teaching the social skills they need to navigate the real world.\u201dYet where it works, Autcraft shows how powerful it can be to create social environments centred on a common interest, says Matthew Lerner at Stony Brook University in New York. \u201cIt builds from the interests and passions of people with autism rather than trying to redirect or surprise them.\u201dMinecraft has helped Keith Stuart, games editor at The Guardian, build a relationship with his autistic son Zac, inspiring his forthcoming novel, A Boy Made of Blocks.\u201cMost games have missions and objectives, pushing you in certain directions. Minecraft presents you with a world and a bunch of tools and you can do what you want. If Zac just wanted to roam the landscape hunting sheep or digging holes, he could. He is free to express himself. There are rules but they are very clear and don\u2019t change. The powerful combination of openness and clear rules definitely appeals to my son.\u201cI\u2019ve written about this for The Guardian and had a flood of parents saying it is exactly what happened with their son or daughter.\u201cAs a parent of a child with autism, I worry about putting him in social situations. Autcraft and similar servers [see main story] try to create an environment in which people can express themselves without fear. That\u2019s important to parents who are nervous about what their children will encounter in multiplayer online games.\u201cParents often have a managerial relationship with video games, but far from potentially being damaging to children, they can give us a new way to communicate. We learned so much about Zac and what he liked and what he wanted to be through talking to him about Minecraft.\u201dThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cYour place or Minecraft?\u201dMore on these topics: \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3071\n                                        \n                                        , published 30 April 2016\n                                    Previous article\n                                                New Scientist Live\n                                            Next article\n                                                One Per Cent\n                                            ",

The egg is 17 centimetres long and 8 centimetres wide.Features of the skeleton suggest it is an oviraptorid \u2013 a two-legged dinosaur that had a bird-like head and feathers.The egg appears to be 72 to 66 million years old. It was probably buried rapidly in sand or mud to allow its remarkable preservation, says Ma. \u201cIt is very rare to find dinosaur embryos, especially ones that are intact,\u201d she says.The embryos of modern birds also adopt a tucked posture to protect themselves for hatching. This suggests the posture first evolved in dinosaurs, not in modern birds as was previously thought, says Ma. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had embryos well-preserved enough to see this before,\u201d she says.A reconstruction of an oviraptorosaur dinosaur embryo that is close to hatchingLida XingA reconstruction of an oviraptorosaur dinosaur embryo that is close to hatchingLida XingLittle is known about the egg\u2019s origins, except that it was found in Shahe Industrial Park in Ganzhou City in southern China and donated to the museum in 2000. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure how it was first discovered but we guess it was something related to construction work,\u201d says Ma.Journal reference: iScience, DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103516 Journal reference: iScience, DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103516 More on these topics: ",

With a length of more than 2.5 metres, Arthropleura is the largest arthropod \u2013 invertebrates with jointed legs, such as scorpions and crabs \u2013 ever to have existed on Earth. The new specimen appears to be the biggest found to date.In January 2018, Neil Davies at the University of Cambridge and his colleagues stumbled across the fossil by chance on Howick Beach in Northumberland during a geological tour of England and Wales.\u201cWe saw that there was a very large piece of sandstone cliff that had fallen off and it had split down the middle as it fell,\u201d says Davies. \u201cWe had a quick peak inside the crack that had formed and saw that there was a really large fossil inside there.\u201dAfter extracting the remains, they determined that the fossil was a segment from the rear of Arthropleura. This section was around 76 centimetres long and 36 centimetres wide. The team then calculated that the creature must originally have been 2.63 metres long and 55 centimetres wide.\u201cWe can estimate they are the largest arthropod to have ever walked on Earth,\u201d says Davies.

An analysis of the samples suggests the environment is home to 77 species \u2013 a greater number than found during all previous studies below Antarctica\u2019s ice put together.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a tantalising view of one of our least-known habitats,\u201d says David Barnes at the British Antarctic Survey, who studied the organisms under the microscope. \u201cThese two samples are very rich. The thing that really leaps out is just how rich the bryozoans \u2013 the sea moss animals \u2013 are.\u201dRadiocarbon dating shows some of the bryozoans are several thousand years old. Most of the species found are immobile, so their discovery in such a hostile and low-food environment suggests they are surviving on phytoplankton carried by poorly understood currents beneath the ice shelves.\u00a0They appear to be growing just as fast as the same species found growing on open-water continental shelves, to Barnes\u2019s surprise. He says it shows how long life can persist with very little food and by conserving energy.The research follows another study earlier this year that found a surprising array of sponges on a boulder deep beneath Antarctica\u2019s ice.\u00a0 The variety of life found this time suggests that environments below the ice are more habitable than previously thought, says Barnes. \u201cPerhaps life is capable of surviving much more ice cover than we thought was the case,\u201d he says.However, Barnes and his colleagues note that this undisturbed and biodiverse habitat beneath the ice \u201ccould be the first habitat to go extinct\u201d as Antarctica\u2019s ice shelves collapse due to climate change.Journal reference: Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2021.11.015.Journal reference: Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2021.11.015.Sign up to Wild Wild Life, a free monthly newsletter celebrating the diversity and science of animals, plants and Earth\u2019s other weird and wonderful inhabitantsMore on these topics: ",
    "doc6": "Sign up to read our regular email newslettersThe size of a child\u2019s hippocampus can be limited by stress, and US state welfare schemes that give families $500 a month or more are linked to a reduction in this associationBy Jason Arunn MurugesuIllustration of the hippocampus in a child\u2019s brainScience Photo Library / AlamyIllustration of the hippocampus in a child\u2019s brainScience Photo Library / AlamyHigher payments from US welfare schemes can reduce the impact that living in a low-income household has on the size of a crucial region of a child\u2019s brain.David Weissman at Harvard University in Massachusetts, and his colleagues analysed images of the brains of more than 11,000 children aged 9 and 10 in the US, looking specifically at the size of each child\u2019s hippocampus.\u201cThe hippocampus is a brain region involved in learning and memory,\u201d says Weissman. Its development is believed to be impaired by excess stress, which can be caused by growing up in poverty, he says.\u201cPrior studies show that kids with small hippocampal volumes are more likely to develop internalising problems [such as anxiety and social withdrawal] and develop depression,\u201d he says.The children came from 17 states, and while they aren\u2019t wholly representative of the US population they are \u201cpretty close\u201d, according to Weissman. The data set is slightly skewed towards more urban areas because the imaging can only be done in places that have available neuroimaging equipment and related expertise.Weissman and his team looked at whether a state had expanded Medicaid, a federally subsidised healthcare scheme, in 2017. That year, states had to choose whether to begin covering a portion of the services that were previously fully covered by the federal government. Just over 7500 of the children involved lived in states that expanded Medicaid.Then the researchers analysed the average amount of welfare benefits people in each state received under various anti-poverty schemes. The higher this total, the more generous they considered the state\u2019s benefits system. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough estimate, but it works,\u201d says Weissman.Combining this with the brain imagery revealed that children in families that received fewer welfare benefits from their state had a smaller hippocampus than average. This link was stronger in states with a high cost of living.The team found there was a 37 per cent reduction in the association between lower family incomes and a smaller hippocampus in states that gave each family receiving welfare payments on average $500 a month or more, compared with those that gave less than $500 a month.The link between receiving better welfare payments and a smaller hippocampus was also reduced by 19 per cent in states that had expanded Medicaid compared with those that hadn\u2019t.Weissman says the results aren\u2019t surprising, but it is still \u201cshocking\u201d to see how major government policy decisions have an actual effect on the brain.\u201cIf your goal is to have a fairer society where this doesn\u2019t happen, then you should be pushing for policies that give more cash benefits to poorer families,\u201d he says.\u201cI think that this finding is tremendously important,\u201d says Jane Barlow at the University of Oxford. \u201cThe research [in this field] now clearly shows social adversity can become biologically embedded during the prenatal period and early years of a child\u2019s life as a result of the way in which they impact the neurological development of the child.\u201dReference: PsyArXiv, DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/8nhejMore on these topics: ",

China\u2019s ambitious quantum computing efforts are all under the oversight of one man, Jian-Wei PanBy Matthew SparkesXinhua/AlamyGOVERNMENTS and companies around the world are racing to build a useful quantum computer, and the stakes are as high as the R&D budgets. Such a machine could crack encryption wide open, boost the power of artificial intelligence and help develop unique materials and drugs.A big player in the field is China, which has a centralised and extremely well-funded government project hoovering up talent, all under the oversight of one man: Jian-Wei Pan.The same words crop up repeatedly when you discuss Pan with those who know him: reserved, focused, driven and bright. He is often referred to as the \u201cfather of quantum\u201d.He attended the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1987 and later the University of Vienna in Austria for his doctorate, ultimately returning to USTC to run one of the largest and most successful quantum research groups in the world. In Vienna, he worked under the prominent physicist Anton Zeilinger, who later said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the emergence of quantum technology without Jian-Wei Pan.\u201dGregor Weihs at the University of Innsbruck, also in Austria, worked with Pan in Vienna and recalls his time there. \u201cInitially he didn\u2019t have any experimental experience, but it was obvious that he understood quantum physics better than any of us, and had amazingly creative ideas,\u201d he says.\u201cHe was certainly driven and motivated to build bigger things,\u201d says Thomas Jennewein at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who also worked with Pan in Vienna and helped him set up a new quantum research lab at USTC in 2002.After returning to China, Pan had a meteoric rise. He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011, its youngest ever member, and the World Academy of Sciences the following year. He became vice-president of USTC in 2014.Pan\u2019s work has yielded huge results \u2013 it has been cited in nearly 50,000 other scientific papers \u2013 and has in turn led to a lot of government investment. A quantum laboratory that was opened at USTC in 2020 cost a reported $10 billion. Such backing has yielded big results of late.Tech giants and research teams around the world have been in a race to outdo each other when it comes to quantum supremacy, the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem that is impossible for classical computers. In July 2021, USTC announced it had surpassed Google\u2019s claimed quantum supremacy achievement by solving a problem three orders of magnitude harder than that performed by Google\u2019s Sycamore machine. In September, USTC bested its own benchmark by another three orders of magnitude.USTC is making great strides in quantum communication too. It recently revealed that the world\u2019s largest metropolitan quantum network \u2013 which involves banks, universities and government buildings across the city of Hefei in China \u2013 has been running for nearly three years. In 2016, USTC put the first quantum satellite into orbit, demonstrating unhackable communications with ground stations on Earth.Pan\u2019s influence in Chinese science is large and growing. He is the vice-chair of the Jiusan Society, a minor political party that serves as a kind of think tank on scientific and educational issues.It remains to be seen which country or company will be first to develop a practical quantum computer, but Pan and USTC seem likely to remain at the centre of this field for the near future.This was a year of tackling great challenges, from the covid-19 pandemic to climate change. But 2021 was also rich in scientific discoveries and major advances.More on these topics: \n                                        Magazine issue\n                                        \n                                            3365\n                                        \n                                        , published 18 December 2021\n                                    Previous article\n                                                2021 in review: Space tourism begins \u2013 for billionaires, anyway\n                                            Next article\n                                                2021 in review: When a brain blob in a dish grew a pair of \u2018eyes\u2019\n                                            ",

He pretends to grab it with his left but, while his fingers obscure it, he lets it drop back into the right \u2013 a classic sleight of hand called the French drop. Garcia-Pelegrin, who began performing magic when he was a student, has fooled countless people with this trick. But today\u2019s audience isn\u2019t buying it: Stuka the Eurasian jay moves her beak towards his right hand, which he opens to give her the treat.Comparative psychologists have often employed deception to explore how animals think. For example, they have used boxes with false bottoms to switch one type of food for another, studying the reactions of dogs and apes to understand how they form mental representations of hidden objects. But the French drop experiment is something new. It is part of the first study to explicitly compare how animals and people react to magic tricks designed to fool humans.Such illusions offer a fascinating window on our minds: they highlight gaps in our perception and attention that magicians exploit to disguise what is in front of our eyes. But what about other animals \u2013 do they fall for the same tricks we do? Could their susceptibility to magic tricks highlight flaws in their perception, or even reveal kinds of intelligence we didn\u2019t know they had?\u201cThe interesting thing is the comparison with us,\u201d says Garcia-Pelegrin at the University of Cambridge. \u201cOnce we have the theory of why a trick works on humans, we can see why it works, or not, on another species, and that tells us about their vision system, their attentional system, their perceptive system \u2026\n        Continue reading\n    \n        Subscribe for unlimited digital access\n    \n        Subscribe now for unlimited access\n    Existing subscribers, please log in with your email address to link your account access.Paid quarterlyInclusive of applicable taxes (VAT)"
